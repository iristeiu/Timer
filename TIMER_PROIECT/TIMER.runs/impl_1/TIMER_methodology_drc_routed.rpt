2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell debouncer_min/sec_unit[3]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) counter/dir_reg/CLR, counter/min_unit_reg[0]/CLR, counter/min_unit_reg[1]/CLR, counter/min_unit_reg[2]/CLR, counter/min_unit_reg[3]/CLR, counter/min_zec_reg[0]/CLR, counter/min_zec_reg[1]/CLR, counter/min_zec_reg[2]/CLR, counter/min_zec_reg[3]/CLR, counter/sec_unit_reg[0]/CLR, counter/sec_unit_reg[1]/CLR, counter/sec_unit_reg[2]/CLR, counter/sec_unit_reg[3]/CLR, counter/sec_zec_reg[0]/CLR, counter/sec_zec_reg[1]/CLR (the first 15 of 50 listed).
